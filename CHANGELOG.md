---

## 2026-06-16

### Fixes and improvements

#### SaaS app

- **Organization members**: Removed the role permissions summary box from the members settings page. Role descriptions now appear only inside the role select dropdown (capped to one line), and the select trigger shows only the role label for a compact layout.

### Changed

#### Dependencies

- **Development dependencies**: Bumped Turborepo to `2.9.18` and `@tailwindcss/typography` to `0.5.20`. Refresh the lockfile with `pnpm install` after pulling.

---

## 2026-06-06

### Changed

#### Dependencies

- **Production dependencies**: Bumped `cookie` from `0.7.2` to `1.1.1` (major) across the lockfile.
- **Development dependencies**: Bumped `oxlint-tsgolint` to `0.23.0`, Turborepo to `2.9.16`, and `@content-collections/core` to `0.15.1`. Refresh the lockfile with `pnpm install` after pulling.

---

## 2026-06-04

### Changed

#### Dependencies

- **Production dependencies**: Bumped 29 production packages, including Next.js `16.2.7`, React and React DOM `19.2.7`, Better Auth `1.6.14`, Vitest `4.1.8`, `next-intl` `4.13.0`, and other workspace runtime and tooling dependencies. Refresh the lockfile with `pnpm install` after pulling.

---

## 2026-06-02

### Fixes and improvements

#### SaaS app

- **Organization settings**: Only organization owners now see the delete organization section in general settings. Admins still retain access to the rest of organization settings.

---

### Removed

#### Auth

- **Username plugin**: Removed the Better Auth `username()` plugin along with the `username` and `displayUsername` columns from the Prisma and Drizzle user schemas. This eliminates the unauthenticated `POST /api/auth/is-username-available` endpoint, which allowed anonymous username enumeration. Apply the schema change with `pnpm --filter @repo/database push` (this drops the two columns).

---

## 2026-05-27

### Changed

#### Infrastructure

- **Node.js and pnpm**: The workspace now requires Node.js `>=22` and pins `pnpm@11.3.0`. Turborepo was upgraded to the latest 2.9.x release.
- **Dependabot**: Removed the open-pull-requests limit and Dependabot cooldown so daily upgrade PRs are no longer capped at two concurrent updates. `pnpm-workspace.yaml` still enforces `minimumReleaseAge: 1440` (one day) at install time.
- **Lint tooling**: Moved `oxlint-tsgolint` from root dependencies to devDependencies so it is only installed for development workflows.

---

## 2026-05-25

### Fixes and improvements

#### Payments

- **Stripe one-time checkout**: Creating a checkout link for a user or organization that already has a Stripe customer no longer sends `customer_creation` alongside `customer`, which Stripe rejects with a parameter conflict error.

#### Marketing and SaaS apps

- **Theme toggle**: `ColorModeToggle` defers reading `next-themes` until after mount so the marketing and SaaS toggles render consistent server markup and client hydration without `suppressHydrationWarning`, fixing the active indicator jumping or mismatching on first paint.

#### Marketing

- **Content Collections**: `content-collections` config now uses the `content` option instead of the deprecated `collections` field (0.14+ migration), keeping the marketing content pipeline on the supported API.

---

## 2026-05-21

### Fixes and improvements

#### SaaS app

- **Organization members**: Role selects are ordered member → admin → owner (least to most access). The members settings page includes a role permissions summary, and each role option shows a short description of what it can do.

---

## 2026-05-20

### Removed

#### Mail

- **NewUser template**: Removed the unused `NewUser` email template, its `mailTemplates` wiring, orphaned per-locale `mail.json` entries, and the `common.otp` string that was only referenced there. Signup and email changes continue to use the email verification template.

### Changed

#### Dependencies

- **Workspace prune**: Dropped direct dependencies that were never imported from their package trees, removed the `openapi-schema` helper that only supported the removed `openapi-merge` dependency, and refreshed the lockfile so installs stay lean while type-check and tests keep passing.

---

## 2026-05-18

### Changed

#### Mail

- **React Email 6**: The mail workspace now uses the unified `react-email` package (v6). Separate `@react-email/components` and `@react-email/render` dependencies were removed in favor of imports from `react-email`. The mail preview app replaces `@react-email/preview-server` with `@react-email/ui` per the v6 upgrade guide. Email templates were reformatted with oxfmt.

---

## 2026-05-13

### Fixes and improvements

#### Infrastructure

- **Dependency minimum release age**: A 1-day minimum release age is now enforced at two levels to reduce supply chain attack exposure. Dependabot is configured with `cooldown: default-days: 1` so upgrade PRs are not opened immediately for freshly published versions. `pnpm-workspace.yaml` sets `settings.minimumReleaseAge: 1440` (minutes) so pnpm v11+ will also refuse to install any package version younger than one day, including transitive dependencies. Together these ensure a community-detection window before newly published — potentially compromised — versions reach the project.
- **pnpm v11**: The monorepo now targets pnpm `11.1.1`, with package-manager-only build settings moved from the root `package.json` into `pnpm-workspace.yaml` so installs and CI behave correctly on the v11 toolchain.

#### Marketing and SaaS apps

- **Theme toggle**: Light/dark controls in the marketing and SaaS apps render with correct server markup and no longer rely on a client-only placeholder that hid the toggle before hydration.

---

## 2026-05-09

### Fixes and improvements

#### Database

- **Two-factor authentication schema**: Added the missing Better Auth `verified` flag to the `TwoFactor` Prisma model, generated Prisma Zod schema, and PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite Drizzle schemas so two-factor enrollment state is represented consistently across database adapters.

---

## 2026-05-06

### Fixes and improvements

#### SaaS app

- **Account security settings**: Passkeys can now be renamed from the passkey list, and the rename dialog opens automatically after creating a new passkey. The passkey list shows user-defined names without the device type prefix and falls back to “Unnamed passkey” for legacy passkeys without a saved name. The two-factor authentication block remains visible when a password has not been configured and now explains that a password is required before two-factor authentication can be enabled.

---

## 2026-04-24 v3.3.2

### Fixes and improvements

#### SaaS app

- **Organization general settings**: Organization name field now syncs when client data loads; success and error toasts use dedicated `organizations.settings` i18n keys. After renaming, the organization list query is refetched, the active organization is refreshed, and the name form resets to the saved value. The organization switcher no longer briefly shows “Personal account” when opening account settings with an active organization (active-org query keeps previous data across route key changes).

---

## 2026-04-20 v3.3.1

### Fixes and improvements

#### Database

- **Drizzle notifications and schema**: Notification persistence (preferences, insert support, listing rows, unread counts, mark read) is implemented in `@repo/database` for both Prisma and Drizzle, so the Drizzle scaffold no longer mixes in Prisma-style `db` calls. The Drizzle schema barrel (`drizzle/schema/index.ts`) re-exports the PostgreSQL schema (aligned with the Drizzle client) and exposes `NotificationType` / `NotificationTarget` for type-safe consumers.
- **`user.lastActiveOrganizationId` in Drizzle**: Added on PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite user tables so Drizzle schemas match the Prisma user model and auth hooks that read this field.
- **Organization lookups (Drizzle)**: `findFirst`-based helpers now normalize missing rows to `null`, matching Prisma `findUnique` behavior for tests and callers.

#### Packages

- **`@repo/notifications`**: Dropped the thin `list`, `mark-read`, and `preferences` modules; the package index re-exports the shared notification query helpers from `@repo/database` next to create/welcome/resolve-link.

#### API

- **Notifications procedures**: List and unread-count handlers use the database row helpers from `@repo/notifications` / `@repo/database` and apply `resolveNotificationLink` when shaping list responses.

#### SaaS app

- **Notification center**: Removed interval-based refetching of notifications from the notification center UI.

Related: [issue #2395](https://github.com/supastarter/supastarter-nextjs/issues/2395) (Drizzle + Postgres scaffold parity).

---

## 2026-03-30 v3.3.0

### Added

#### Database

- **Notification entity**: New `Notification` model in Prisma and Drizzle (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite) with user association and read/unread state.

#### Packages

- **`@repo/notifications`**: Shared module for notification definitions (`catalog`), creating and listing notifications, marking as read, per-user preferences, and a welcome notification helper.

#### API

- **Notifications oRPC**: Procedures to list notifications, get unread count, mark one or all as read, and read/update notification preferences.

#### SaaS app

- **Notification Center**: Navbar UI to view notifications and mark them read.
- **Notification preferences**: Account settings page and form for per-channel preferences; server-only notification logic is kept out of the client bundle for the preferences form.
- **Auth**: Database hook after user creation creates a welcome in-app notification via `@repo/notifications`.

#### Mail and i18n

- **`Notification` email template** and template wiring; **saas** and **mail** translation keys for notifications in English, German, Spanish, and French.

#### UI

- **Popover** and **Switch** components exported from `@repo/ui` for notification UI patterns.

### Changed

#### SaaS settings

- **Account and organization settings**: Removed nested `settings/layout.tsx` for account and org routes; settings sub-pages (general, billing, security, members, etc.) are updated to match the flatter structure. New **Notifications** route under account settings.

#### NavBar and theming

- **NavBar**: Reworked layout and behavior (including notification entry points); **Tailwind theme** (`tooling/tailwind/theme.css`) and related component tweaks for consistency.

---

## 2026-03-24 v3.2.0

### Testing

- **Vitest setup**: Added Vitest configuration (`vitest.config.ts`) to `apps/saas`, `apps/marketing`, and `packages/api` so unit tests can be run with `pnpm test` in each workspace package.
- **Unit tests**: Added initial unit test suites covering `base-url` helpers in both apps, content utilities in the marketing app, and organization membership logic, slug generation, and oRPC procedure wiring in the API package.
- **CI integration**: Added a unit test job to the GitHub Actions workflow so all unit tests run on every pull request; the Turbo `test` task no longer depends on `build`.

---

## 2026-03-24 v3.1.1

### Fixes and improvements

#### SaaS app

- **Checkout return after payment**: After Stripe checkout, users are redirected to `/checkout-return`, which polls `listPurchases` until an active plan appears (avoiding a race with webhook processing). The pricing table passes `organizationId` in the return URL when applicable. If confirmation does not arrive within the timeout, users are sent to `/choose-plan`. Added `checkoutReturn` copy in English, German, Spanish, and French.

---

## 2026-03-23 v3.1.0

### Tooling

- **Lint and format stack**: Replaced Biome with [Oxlint](https://oxc.rs/docs/guide/usage/linter) and [Oxfmt](https://oxc.rs/docs/guide/usage/formatter) for faster linting and formatting across the monorepo.
- **Workspace layout**: Consolidated Oxlint/Oxfmt dependencies at the repository root (pnpm catalog) and removed redundant per-package Biome configs; lockfile and many source files were updated to match the new rules and formatter output.

---

## 2026-03-18 v3.0.3

### Added

#### Organizations

- **Persist last active organization**: A new `lastActiveOrganizationId` field is stored on the user record whenever the active organization changes. On next sign-in, the session is automatically restored to that organization via a better-auth `databaseHook`, so users no longer land on a default/empty organization after logging back in.

---

## 2026-03-09 v3.0.2

### Fixes and improvements

#### Marketing app

- **Tailwind Typography**: Added `@tailwindcss/typography` plugin to the marketing app so `prose` and `prose-invert` classes render styled content correctly (blog posts, legal pages, changelogs)
- **Page spacing**: Normalized top padding across marketing pages (blog list, blog post, changelog, contact, legal) from `pt-24 pb-16` to `py-16` for consistent vertical rhythm
- **Image hostname**: Added `picsum.photos` to the allowed remote image hostnames in `next.config.ts` for blog placeholder images

---

## 2026-03-08 v3.0.1

### Fixes and improvements

#### i18n and translation usage

- **Single `useTranslations()` per component**: Removed redundant `useTranslations()` hooks (e.g. `tSignup`, `tLogin`, `tSettings`, `tPricing`, `tActions`, `tAria`, `tAvatar`, `tOrgSettings`) across marketing and SaaS components. Components now use a single `t` for all translation keys.
- **Color mode labels**: Marketing and SaaS `ColorModeToggle` now use the full key path `common.colorMode.${option.value}` for option labels.
- **Organization and settings keys**: `ChangeOrganizationNameForm` now uses `organizations.settings.changeName.notifications.success` / `error` and `settings.save` via the shared `t`; other organization and settings forms (delete org, logo, change email/name/password, two-factor) use the single `t` for their copy.

#### Payments and purchases

- **List purchases enrichment**: `listPurchases` (packages/api) now returns each purchase with resolved `planId` and `planPrice` from the payments helper, so clients receive plan data without extra lookups.
- **Purchase helper**: `createPurchasesHelper` and `getActivePlanFromPurchases` in `packages/payments` now accept a `ResolvedPurchase` type (with optional `planId` and `planPrice`) and use `resolvePurchasePlan` / `resolvePurchasePlanId` to avoid duplicate provider price resolution when purchases are already enriched.

#### UI

- **SaaS NavBar**: Nav link list uses `flex-nowrap`, `overflow-x-auto`, and responsive `md:overflow-visible md:flex-wrap` so links scroll horizontally on small screens and wrap on larger ones; sidebar layout keeps `md:flex-nowrap` for the vertical nav.

---

## 2026-03-08 v3.0.0

### Major architectural changes and breaking updates

This release restructures the monorepo around separate marketing and SaaS applications, expands localization, and reworks billing configuration. The major version bump reflects multiple breaking changes to app paths, imports, route structure, configuration, and payment data.

#### Summary of breaking changes

- **App split**: The former `apps/web` application has been split into dedicated `apps/marketing` and `apps/saas` Next.js apps
- **Route changes**: Marketing routes and SaaS auth/app routes moved into new App Router layouts and path groups
- **Config scoping**: Marketing and SaaS now use app-local `config.ts`, `types.ts`, and i18n request/config helpers instead of sharing `apps/web` config
- **Payments model**: Billing now uses plan-based configuration and provider `priceId` values instead of client-facing `productId`
- **Purchase schema**: Purchase records were renamed from `productId` to `priceId` across Prisma, Drizzle, and generated Zod schemas
- **i18n split**: Translations are now split by scope (`marketing`, `saas`, `mail`, `shared`) and loaded through a new `getMessagesForLocale` helper
- **Translation key updates**: Marketing and SaaS UI copy now uses full-length translation keys consistently across forms, nav, pricing, settings, admin, and auth flows
- **API removals**: The contact and newsletter API routers were removed from `packages/api`
- **Mail changes**: Newsletter signup email/template support was removed and mail rendering now resolves scoped translations from `@repo/i18n`
- **UI moves**: Several SaaS-specific UI primitives were moved out of `@repo/ui` into `apps/saas/modules/shared`
- **Workspace tooling**: The workspace now relies on a pnpm catalog for shared dependency versions

#### Dedicated marketing and SaaS applications

- **New apps**: Added standalone `apps/marketing` and `apps/saas` applications with their own `package.json`, `next.config.ts`, `tsconfig.json`, global styles, robots, layouts, config, and Playwright setup
- **Marketing app**: Public pages now live in `apps/marketing`, including home, blog index and post routes, changelog, contact, legal pages, sitemap generation, locale switching, and refreshed home-page sections
- **SaaS app**: Protected application routes now live in `apps/saas`, with separate authenticated and unauthenticated layouts, account dashboards, organization settings, onboarding, auth pages, and API routes
- **Removed**: Deleted the old combined `apps/web` app and its shared layouts, proxy, sitemap, and duplicated feature modules

**Migration steps:**

1. Update any scripts, deploy targets, env vars, or local workflows that referenced `apps/web`
2. Point public-site work to `apps/marketing` and protected-product work to `apps/saas`
3. Update route assumptions for auth pages (`/login`, `/signup`, etc.) and SaaS app layouts if you maintain custom links or middleware

#### Localization and content restructuring

- **Scoped translations**: Split locale files into `packages/i18n/translations/{locale}/marketing.json`, `saas.json`, `mail.json`, and `shared.json`
- **New locales**: Added Spanish (`es`) and French (`fr`) alongside English and German
- **Typed config**: Added typed i18n config/interfaces and exported `config`, `Locale`, and scoped message types from `@repo/i18n`
- **Message loading**: Added `getMessagesForLocale(locale, scope)` with shared-message merging and default-locale fallback behavior
- **Key normalization**: Updated marketing and SaaS components to use explicit full-length translation keys instead of shorter or ambiguous key paths
- **App wiring**: Marketing and SaaS now each own their locale request/update helpers and locale-aware providers

**Migration steps:**

1. Move any custom translation keys into the new scoped translation files
2. Replace imports of old flat message utilities with `getMessagesForLocale`
3. Rename any custom UI translation lookups that still rely on older short-form key paths
4. Update any code that assumed only `en` and `de` locales exist

#### Payments, auth, and data model updates

- **Plan-based checkout**: `createCheckoutLink` now accepts `planId`, `type`, and optional `interval`, then resolves provider price IDs server-side
- **Payments config**: Replaced `productId` pricing config with typed plan definitions, `priceId` fields, `requireActiveSubscription`, and reusable plan lookup helpers
- **Purchase queries**: `listPurchases` now accepts an optional input object by default, simplifying direct server/client calls
- **Database schema**: Renamed purchase `productId` to `priceId` in Prisma and generated validation output
- **Auth updates**: Better Auth now uses the SaaS base URL, raises the minimum password length to 8, reserves `chatbot` as an organization slug, and updates invitation redirects to `/login` and `/signup`

**Migration steps:**

1. Rename any custom purchase schema usage from `productId` to `priceId`
2. Update payment integrations to pass `planId` and `interval` rather than provider product IDs
3. Regenerate and apply database migrations if your environment still uses the old purchase column name
4. Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_SAAS_URL` and payment provider price env vars are set for the new split-app setup

#### Mail, API, and shared component cleanup

- **Removed API endpoints**: Deleted the contact and newsletter oRPC modules from `packages/api`
- **Mail package refactor**: Moved mail helpers into `packages/mail/lib`, added scoped mail translation loading, and removed the newsletter signup template/export
- **Marketing forms**: Marketing contact/newsletter flows were refactored along with the new app split rather than continuing to rely on the removed shared API modules
- **SaaS UI ownership**: Moved password input, settings list/item, page header, and related shared components into the SaaS app to avoid over-generalizing them in `@repo/ui`
- **Workspace cleanup**: Added pnpm catalog version management and refreshed package wiring across apps and packages

---

## 2026-03-05 v2.0.6

### Refactoring

#### oRPC server-side client and payments

- **Server-side oRPC**: Introduced a server-only oRPC client that calls the API router directly (no HTTP) during SSR. Added `@orpc/server` (1.13.6) to `apps/web`, new `orpc.server.ts` that sets `globalThis.$orpcClient` via `createRouterClient(router, ...)`, and `instrumentation.ts` plus root layout import so the server client is registered before use.
- **orpc-client**: Client now throws on the server ("RPCLink is not allowed on the server side") and uses `window.location.origin` for the RPC URL; exports `orpcClient` as `globalThis.$orpcClient ?? createORPCClient(link)` so server code uses the direct router client.
- **API**: `packages/api` now exports `router`; `payments.listPurchases` procedure returns the purchases array directly instead of `{ purchases }`.
- **Payments**: Removed `getPurchases` and `apps/web/modules/saas/payments/lib/server.ts`. Account and organization billing pages and choose-plan page now call `orpcClient.payments.listPurchases()` directly; removed `attemptAsync` (es-toolkit) in favor of direct `await`. `usePurchases` hook updated to use `data ?? []` to match the new procedure return shape.

---

## 2026-03-05 v2.0.5

### Fixes

#### SaaS app layout – purchase list organization scoping

- **Payments / organizations**: When redirecting unsubscribed users to the choose-plan page, `organizationId` is now only passed to the payments list when organizations are enabled **and** billing is attached to the organization (`billingAttachedTo === "organization"`). Previously, `organizationId` was passed whenever organizations were enabled, which could incorrectly scope or look up purchases by organization when billing was configured at the user level and cause a redirect loop.

---

## 2026-03-02 v2.0.4

### Dependency updates

#### oRPC upgrade

- **@orpc packages**: Upgraded from 1.13.2 to 1.13.6 across the monorepo
- **apps/web**: Updated `@orpc/client` to 1.13.6
- **packages/api**: Updated `@orpc/client`, `@orpc/json-schema`, `@orpc/openapi`, `@orpc/server`, and `@orpc/zod` to 1.13.6

---

## 2026-02-05 v2.0.3

### Radix UI dependency consolidation

#### Unified Radix UI package migration

- **Major dependency update**: Migrated from individual `@radix-ui/react-*` packages to unified `radix-ui` package (v1.4.3)

## 2026-02-05 v2.0.2

### AI Chat refactoring and UI improvements

#### AI Chat simplification

- **Major refactoring**: Simplified AI chat feature to streaming-only interface, removing chat persistence
- **Removed**: Chat storage and CRUD operations (create, list, find, update, delete, add-message procedures)
- **Removed**: `AiChat` database model from all schemas (Prisma, Drizzle MySQL/PostgreSQL/SQLite)
- **Removed**: Database queries for AI chats (`ai-chats.ts` files)
- **Simplified**: AI router now only exposes a single `stream` endpoint for real-time AI responses
- **Refactored**: `AiChat` component to use streaming without persistence, using `@ai-sdk/react`'s `useChat` hook
- **Simplified**: Chatbot pages removed prefetching logic for chat lists and individual chats
- **New**: `stream-message` procedure that streams AI responses without storing conversations

**Breaking changes:**

- Any code using `orpcClient.ai.chats.*` endpoints will need to be updated
- Database migrations will need to drop the `ai_chat` table if it exists
- Chat history persistence is no longer available - conversations are session-only

#### UI component improvements

- **NavBar**: Added conditional bottom border when scrolled (`border-b` when `!isTop`)
- **Button component**: Removed icon opacity styling (`[&>svg]:opacity-60`) for better icon visibility
- **Global styles**: Added consistent Lucide icon stroke-width (`1.75`) for improved icon rendering

---

## 2026-02-05 v2.0.1

### UI component enhancements and design improvements

#### Toast component redesign

- **Major enhancement**: Complete redesign of the toast component with custom styling and improved UX
- Added custom `Toast` component with support for different types (success, error, info, warning, loading, default)
- Added automatic icons for each toast type using Lucide icons

### Major architectural changes and breaking updates

This release introduces significant architectural changes that require migration steps. The major version bump reflects multiple breaking changes across the codebase. All existing code has been updated to use the new structure, but custom code will need manual migration.

#### Summary of breaking changes

- **Docs application**: Moved from web app to standalone Next.js app (`apps/docs`)
- **UI components**: Moved from `apps/web/modules/ui/` to `packages/ui/`

#### Dedicated docs application

Documentation has been moved from the web app to a standalone Next.js application using fumadocs.

**Breaking changes:**

- Removed docs routes from `apps/web/app/(marketing)/[locale]/docs/[[...path]]/`
- Removed docs API route `apps/web/app/api/docs-search/route.ts`
- Removed `apps/web/app/docs-source.ts`
- Removed all docs content from `apps/web/content/docs/` (including `getting-started/` and `index.mdx`)
- Removed `TableOfContents` component from marketing shared components
- Removed docs image from `apps/web/public/images/docs/login.png`
- Updated `apps/web/content-collections.ts` to exclude docs content
- Updated `apps/web/app/sitemap.ts` to exclude docs routes

**New structure:**

- Created new `apps/docs` application using fumadocs
- Docs now run as a separate Next.js app (default port 3001)
- Docs content moved to `apps/docs/content/docs/`
- Uses fumadocs-ui for improved documentation experience

2. Update any links pointing to `/docs/*` routes - docs are now served from the separate app
3. Remove any imports of `TableOfContents` component
4. Run `pnpm dev` in the `apps/docs` directory to start the docs server (or use `pnpm --filter @repo/docs dev`)
5. Update any CI/CD pipelines that build or deploy docs

#### UI components moved to packages

All UI components have been moved from the web app to a shared package for better reusability across the monorepo.

**Breaking changes:**

- Removed `apps/web/modules/ui/lib/index.ts`
- Removed `apps/web/components.json` (shadcn config file)
- All component imports throughout the codebase have been updated

**New structure:**

- Created `packages/ui` package containing all UI components

2. Update imports of `cn` utility from `apps/web/modules/ui` to `@repo/ui`
3. Remove any references to `components.json` in the web app
4. Install `@repo/ui` as a dependency if using UI components in other packages
5. Update TypeScript path aliases if you had custom ones pointing to the old location

#### Configuration restructuring

The centralized config package has been removed in favor of scoped configuration files for better package isolation.

**Breaking changes:**

- Removed `config/` package entirely:
  - `config/index.ts`
  - `config/package.json`
  - `config/tsconfig.json`
  - `config/types.ts`
- All imports from `@repo/config` or `config` will fail
- Config is now scoped to individual packages

**New structure:**

- Each package now has its own `config.ts` file:
  - `apps/web/config.ts` - Web app configuration
  - `packages/api/config.ts` - API configuration
  - `packages/auth/config.ts` - Auth configuration
  - `packages/i18n/config.ts` - i18n configuration
  - `packages/mail/config.ts` - Mail configuration

**Migration steps:**

1. Update imports from `@repo/config` or `config` to package-specific configs:
   - `import { config } from "@config"` for web app
   - `import { config as i18nConfig } from "@repo/i18n/config"` for package configs
2. Update any code referencing the old config package structure
3. Review each package's config file to understand what configuration is available
4. Update environment variable usage if config structure changed

#### Shared components cleanup

Removed unused shared components that are now available in the UI package.

**Breaking changes:**

- Removed `apps/web/modules/shared/components/Logo.tsx`
- Removed `apps/web/modules/shared/components/Spinner.tsx`
- All imports of these components throughout the codebase have been updated

**Migration steps:**

1. Replace any imports of `Logo` from `@shared/components/Logo` - Logo is now available from `@repo/ui`
2. Replace any imports of `Spinner` - use skeleton components from `@repo/ui` instead
3. Update any custom code that imports these components

#### Mail package restructuring

Mail package has been restructured with a flatter directory structure and improved organization.

**Breaking changes:**

- Removed `packages/mail/src/components/Logo.tsx` (use `@repo/ui` instead)
- Removed `packages/mail/src/provider/custom.ts` provider
- Restructured mail package directory layout:
  - `src/components/` → `components/` (PrimaryButton, Wrapper moved)
  - `src/provider/` → `provider/` (all providers moved)
  - `src/util/` → `util/` (send, templates, translations moved)
- Updated all mail provider implementations to use new config structure
- Updated all mail email templates to use new import paths

**New structure:**

- Flatter directory structure without `src/` directory
- Components, providers, and utilities at package root level

   ```typescript
   import { Logo } from "@repo/ui";
   ```
2. If using custom mail provider, migrate to one of the supported providers:
   - Resend
   - Nodemailer
   - Mailgun
   - Postmark
   - Plunk
   - Console (for development)
3. Update mail provider configuration to use `packages/mail/config.ts`
4. Update any imports from `packages/mail/src/*` to `packages/mail/*`
5. Use `apps/mail-preview` app for previewing emails during development

#### Payments package restructuring

Payments package has been restructured with helper utilities moved to a new location.

**Breaking changes:**

- Moved `packages/payments/src/lib/customer.ts` → `packages/payments/lib/customer.ts`
- Moved `packages/payments/src/lib/helper.ts` → `packages/payments/lib/helper.ts` (new location)
- Removed old `packages/payments/src/lib/helper.ts` (duplicate removed)
- Updated payment provider implementations (Stripe, LemonSqueezy, DodoPayments, Polar)
- Updated payment procedures to use new config structure

**New structure:**

- Helper utilities now in `packages/payments/lib/` (without `src/` prefix)

All components and modules have been updated to use the new import paths throughout the entire codebase.

**Affected areas:**

- UI component imports across all modules (200+ files updated)
- Config imports throughout the codebase
- Shared component imports
- Mail template imports
- Payment provider imports

**Migration steps:**

1. Run `pnpm install` to ensure all workspace dependencies are linked correctly
2. Update any custom code using old import paths:
   - `apps/web/modules/ui/*` → `@repo/ui/*`
   - `@repo/config` → package-specific configs
   - `@shared/components/Logo` → `@repo/ui`
3. Run type checking: `pnpm type-check` to identify any remaining import issues
4. Update any custom scripts or build tools that reference old paths

#### Workspace configuration updates

The workspace structure has been updated to reflect the new package organization.

**Breaking changes:**

- `pnpm-workspace.yaml` still references `config` package (which was removed) - this should be updated manually
- Workspace now includes new `apps/docs` application
- Workspace includes new `packages/ui` package

**Migration steps:**

1. Update `pnpm-workspace.yaml` to remove the `config` entry:
   ```yaml
   packages:
     - apps/*
     - packages/*
     - tooling/*
   ```
2. Run `pnpm install` to refresh workspace links
3. Verify all packages are properly linked with `pnpm list --depth=0`

#### Biome configuration standardization

All Biome configurations have been standardized across the monorepo for consistency.

**Changes:**

- Updated all Biome configurations across packages to use consistent settings
- Standardized Biome config format: all package-level configs now extend root config with `"extends": "//"`
- Root `biome.json` contains shared configuration
- Package-specific `biome.json` files only override when needed
- Database package excludes Prisma-generated zod files from linting

**Migration steps:**

1. If you have custom Biome rules, ensure they follow the new pattern:
   ```json
   {
   	"root": false,
   	"extends": "//"
   }
   ```
2. Run `pnpm format` to apply new formatting rules
3. Run `pnpm lint` to check for any linting issues with new config

#### Package dependencies and workspace structure

Package dependencies have been updated to reflect the new architecture.

**Changes:**

- Added `@repo/ui` as a workspace dependency where needed
- Updated `pnpm-lock.yaml` with new workspace structure (2760+ lines changed)

## 2025-12-01 v1.2.0

### Better-auth 1.4 upgrade

Upgraded `better-auth` from version `1.3.34` to `1.4.4`. This version introduces several breaking changes and improvements.

#### Migration steps

1. **Update dependencies:**
   - Update `better-auth` to `1.4.4` in both `apps/web/package.json` and `packages/auth/package.json`
   - Add `@better-auth/passkey` package (version `^1.4.4`) to `packages/auth/package.json`

2. **Update passkey plugin imports:**
   - In `packages/auth/auth.ts`: Change `import { passkey } from "better-auth/plugins/passkey"` to `import { passkey } from "@better-auth/passkey"`
   - In `packages/auth/client.ts`: Change `passkeyClient` import from `better-auth/client/plugins` to `import { passkeyClient } from "@better-auth/passkey/client"`

3. **Update magicLink callback signature:**
   - Change the `sendMagicLink` callback from `async ({ email, url }, request)` to `async ({ email, url }, ctx)`
   - Extract the request object from context: `const request = ctx?.request as Request`

4. **Update database schema:**
   - Run `pnpm db:push` or create a migration to add the following indexes:
     - `Session`: `@@index([userId])`
     - `Account`: `@@index([userId])`
     - `Verification`: `@@index([identifier])`
     - `Passkey`: `@@index([userId])` and `@@index([credentialID])`
     - `TwoFactor`: `@@index([secret])` and `@@index([userId])`
     - `Member`: `@@index([organizationId])` and `@@index([userId])`
     - `Invitation`: `@@index([organizationId])` and `@@index([email])`
   - Add `createdAt DateTime @default(now())` field to the `Invitation` model

These changes improve database query performance through additional indexes and align with better-auth 1.4's new plugin architecture where passkey functionality is now a separate package.

Updated `@types/react` and `@types/react-dom` from version 19.0.0 to 19.2.2 to include the latest type definitions and bug fixes for React 19.

The pnpm overrides have been consolidated to the root `package.json` for better consistency across the monorepo.

### Optimized pnpm dependency installation

Added `onlyBuiltDependencies` configuration to pnpm settings to optimize installation time by only building Prisma-related packages (`@prisma/client`, `prisma`, and `prisma-zod-generator`) when needed. This reduces unnecessary rebuilds and speeds up dependency installation in the monorepo.

### Added pg dependency

Added `pg` (PostgreSQL client) as a dependency to support the Prisma Rust-free client migration. The `pg` package is required by the Prisma database adapter for PostgreSQL connections.

### Prisma client migration to Rust-free client

In order to reduce the bundle size of the client and improve performance, we have migrated to the Rust-free Prisma client.

#### Migration steps

If you are upgrading your supastarter project to this version, you need to update the way your prisma client is generated:

1. Update `prisma` and `@prisma/client` to the latest version.

2. In the `schema.prisma` file, change the `provider` to `prisma-client`, the `output` to `./generated` and set the `engineType` to `client`.

3. Update the `packages/database/prisma/client.ts` like this:

```ts
import { PrismaPg } from "@prisma/adapter-pg";
import { PrismaClient } from "./generated/client";

const prismaClientSingleton = () => {
	if (!process.env.DATABASE_URL) {
		throw new Error("DATABASE_URL is not set");
	}

	const adapter = new PrismaPg({
		connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
	});

	return new PrismaClient({ adapter });
};

declare global {
	var prisma: undefined | ReturnType<typeof prismaClientSingleton>;
}

// biome-ignore lint/suspicious/noRedeclare: This is a singleton
const prisma = globalThis.prisma ?? prismaClientSingleton();

if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== "production") {
	globalThis.prisma = prisma;
}

export { prisma as db };
```

In case are using a different database than PostgreSQL, see the following documentation on which adapter to use: https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-client/setup-and-configuration/no-rust-engine#3-install-the-driver-adapter

### Next.js 16 migration

If you are updating an existing project, work through the following steps to align with the new Next.js 16 defaults and Supastarter conventions:

1. Upgrade `next`, `react`, and `react-dom` to their latest stable releases in both `package.json` files (`package.json` at the root and `apps/web/package.json` if it exists).

2. Rename the middleware entry point:
   - Move `apps/web/middleware.ts` to `apps/web/proxy.ts`.
   - Inside the renamed file update the exported handler to `export function proxy(...)` (it was previously `middleware`).

3. Remove the inline ESLint configuration from `apps/web/next.config.ts`

4. Update the marketing docs layout `apps/web/app/(marketing)/[locale]/docs/[[...path]]/layout.tsx`, by changing the `DocsLayout` prop from `disableThemeSwitch` to `themeSwitch={{ enabled: true }}`.

See https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/upgrading/version-16 for full migration guide (beyond the supastarter codebase).

### Biome 2.3 upgrade

We have upgraded to Biome 2.3 which introduces some changes to how CSS files are handled and it currently doesn't support the format in which Tailwind CSS 4 is configured, so you need to update the `biome.json` file to ignore the `globals.css` file for now:

```jsonc
{
	"files": {
		"includes": [
			"**",
			"!zod/index.ts",
			"!tailwind-animate.css",
			"!!**/globals.css", // <- ignore this file
		],
	},
	"css": {
		"parser": {
			"tailwindDirectives": true, // <- enable tailwind directives parsing
		},
	},
}
```
